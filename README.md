# Datalus-Tracks (Front to Back Tier)
Code samples from my work at Datalus, where my team and I built an Education Management System web application. This repository demonstrates the Front End, Middle Tier and Back End code I wrote to program the Office Hours functionality; this includes work in C#, ASP.NET MVC 5.x, .Net 4.5, WebApi 2.x, T-SQL, JavaScript, AngularJS, jQuery, AJAX, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap 3.0.

!! (These are only samples- this code will not run on its own) !!
